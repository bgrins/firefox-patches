* The first commit's message is:

* This is the 2nd commit message:

Use l10n module for l10n rather than gcli

Initially GCLI had a couple of helper function (lookup and lookupFormat)
for l10n, but this is bad for 2 (related) reasons: It's a failure to
separate concerns, and practically it means GCLI is loaded more eagerly
than it needs to be.

This change uses a separate l10n module.

* This is the 3rd commit message:

Be clearer about uses of the gcli/index module

Previously the 'gcli' object (from gcli/index) was re-exported from the helpers
module, this change stops that, so the only test directory that was actually
using gcli now gets it directly.

The next step is to make the individual tests that need 'gcli' import it
directly.

* This is the 4th commit message:

Refactor the startup process to move all module discovery to one place

Previously there was commands-index and gcli/index, but now all the
module discovery all happens in commands-index. This means that the
DeveloperToolbar can create Requisitions and FFDisplay objects itself
without the need of helpers (in order to get access to the 'system').

* This is the 5th commit message:

Inline getEvalCommand.

Didn't add anything, but served to confuse what was happening to
requisition.system, which we want to be dynamically swappable.

* This is the 6th commit message:

Output doesn't need the context object; remove it.

* This is the 7th commit message:

Variable rename gcli → system.

Make it clearer what were acting on here

* This is the 8th commit message:

Merge from GCLI web

This is an import of all the changes made in the GCLI repo. See here:
  https://github.com/joewalker/gcli/commits/master
The changes are those from 4 Feb 2015 (d59796b) to 12 Feb 2015 (fd63021)

* This is the 9th commit message:

Refactor DeveloperToolbar code to fit GCLI import

commands-index.js Now has 2 functions which create 'system' objects:
loadForServer() which is designed to be called by GcliActor and loadForTarget()
which is designed to be called by the DeveloperToolbar and the Toolbox.

Some of the changes to GcliActor are to sync with the changes in GCLI.

* This is the 10th commit message:

Make sure all commands have a 'runAt' property

* This is the 11th commit message:

mozilla-central uses " rather than '

* This is the 12th commit message:

Remove unwanted console.log

* This is the 13th commit message:

Remove files not used in Firefox

* This is the 14th commit message:

Dependency on main.js was causing problems, workaround for now

* This is the 15th commit message:

'system' should use a GcliFront not a connector (from GCLI)

GCLI in general should rely on a front rather than a connector which is
a much lower level thing.

* This is the 16th commit message:

Be less brutal with errors

When registering modules it's bad to take the nuclear option because
then nothing works on a small error, so we log instead.

* This is the 17th commit message:

Significant work on GcliActor

* This is the 18th commit message:

Improve support for custom properties for commands

(Imported from GCLI commit with additional changes to uses of the
'specs' function in Firefox)

GCLI has allowed (by turning a blind eye) to commands and other items
that have additional properties. This is used by Firefox to allow
commands to be placed in the toolbox and toolbar buttons with custom
icons.

With remote GCLI it's important that these custom properties are
transferred along with the standard command metadata. This change allows
the 'specs' function to take an array of custom properties which should
be transferred.

* This is the 19th commit message:

Firefox uses " rather than '

* This is the 20th commit message:

Allow remote commands in the toolbox toolbar

* This is the 21st commit message:

Add warning message on use of deprecated functions in environment

* This is the 22nd commit message:

Remove lots of dead code from the init of FFDisplay

Really we should kill FFDisplay entirely, and move the mozui code into
the browser/devtools/commandline folder, but that's for another day.

* This is the 23rd commit message:

Make addon.js safe to load in a child process.

* This is the 24th commit message:

Make cookie.js safe to load in a child process

cookie.js should not use environment.document

* This is the 25th commit message:

Use fat arrow functions

* This is the 26th commit message:

The entire devtoolsModules definition was duplicated. De-dupe

I suspect a merge error.

* This is the 27th commit message:

Merge clientModules into baseModules

Historically they were separate because we thought you might want to
register commands in different places, but now we have the 'location'
system then don't need to be separate.

Also we were previously importing everything and then commenting where
we didn't want the import. Now we're just importing what we need. There
doesn't seem much benefit in saying (badly) what we don't need. More
useful is to just say what we do.

* This is the 28th commit message:

The eyedropper command needs access to chrome not content

* This is the 29th commit message:

Cache the actor

'this' would be the environment and not the gcliActor, so enclose the
tabActor so be sure what we're accessing.

* This is the 30th commit message:

2 types that commands might use need informing about the document.

* This is the 31st commit message:

Remove commented out code (and an extra space)

* This is the 32nd commit message:

There's no point in setting up the target in the constructor

We need to do it in the show() function anyway, so leave it to there.

* This is the 33rd commit message:

Split the screenshot command to have a separate converter for e10s

* This is the 34th commit message:

Include imgur support

We've had this attachment [1] to bug 992386, outstanding for ages. I'm
just totally breaking it, to the point where if we don't include it now
then it will rot forever, so I'm including it now.

This is a basic port of something that was close to r+, so my hunch is
that this changeset doesn't need a significant review. I'm checking this
is now so you can see the steps.

That said, there are some things that I know I've broken here, so you
might want to check ahead to the end result.

It's also possible that by the end this will probably look a lot clearer
viewed from scratch.

* This is the 35th commit message:

Complete pass 1 of tidying up the screenshot command

But we're not done yet. Currently neither the clipboard option nor the
imgur option works, this could have something to do with running in a
content process, and perhaps with sandboxing even if that's not a
problem now, then it will be in the future, so maybe we need to move
that to the converter.

Also the --chrome option is probably not going to work in the content
process, so since commands can only run in a single process, I think
we're going to need some sort of a 'chromescreenshot' command, which can
probably share almost all the code with the 'screenshot' command, but
needs a different document to work from.

* This is the 36th commit message:

Remove hard-coded module list from commands-index

Expected review fix:
https://github.com/joewalker/gecko-dev/commit/a7a75328845edb28aa6426cb6dd6be71870e244e

This splits main.js so the definitions are in definitions.js.

We can't load gDevTools in a child process so the command modules that
load it need to lazyLoad it instead, which is fine because they never
actually need it in the child process.

I've not yet worked out why we need to require(Services) in
console-output. We require it in enough other places that I don't see
the problem with requiring it, but I still don't get it.

It's used here:
https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/devtools/webconsole/console-output.js#30
And should be defined here:
https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/devtools/Loader.jsm?from=Loader.jsm#31

* This is the 37th commit message:

Use WeakMap<Client, Front> rather than WeakMap<Target, Front>

The front belongs to the client rather than the target

Update strings file for recent change to cli.js

Back in joewalker/gcli@dc4a419 (which was merged in
joewalker/gecko-dev@77d1db10) we updated the string but not the
definition. This corrects that.

See also: https://github.com/joewalker/gcli/commit/dc4a419d3ab7e156ecd78d3eaada7e111d0b9510

Stop providing the server content document to types on the client

setContentDocument isn't going to work under e10s, I suspect that no
commands use it any more, but if there are we'll need to fix them.

Use const in place of let when we can

Fix where a number of commands are run

Most non-trivial commands are only going to run correctly on the server or
the client, and our tests are generally good at flushing this out.

Note on the 'jsb' command: I'm not sure this is a particularly useful command,
I'm half of the mind that we should remove it, but I think that's another job.
However I did add a bit of detail to the exec test.

Remove unneeded and confusing function names

Import Cc and Ci for access to nsICookieManager2

Probably needed now because of the changes to the imports in main.js.

Fix cookie command: Use env.document rather than env.target

Confusion over what we had access to client vs server

Minor 'jsb' command fixes

reject errors rather than resolving them, and we're not using aEvt.

Minor: simplify imports

Sync helpers with GCLI.

This should maybe be part of the recent merge, but since helpers.js
isn't part of toolkit/devtools/gcli/source, the merge is manual.

Changes:
- s/isNoDom/isNode
- minor line-wrap fix.
- be more helpful in runTests

Test update. Part 1 (Updates to sync with recent GCLI merge)

This keeps up with the following changes:
- Replace document/globalObject with windowHolder joewalker/gcli@d374a91

Test update. Part 2 (gcli-input → gcli-root and p → div)

joewalker/gcli@30b612e8 [1] changed to using a document with a known
element called div#gcli-root because the original assumed-to-exist element
got removed a while ago in a refactor. This makes the Firefox tests fall
into line.

[1]: https://github.com/joewalker/gcli/commit/30b612e8722c879ed2e785a64f482867d5c5115e

Test update. Part 3 (Update and reduce test skips)

We now have some sort of a DOM available in all environments for testing
so we got rid of all isNoDom skips. Some of the isNoDom skips became
isNode skips due to limitations in the UI automation system.
We commented the reasons for the isPhantonjs skips.
One test skip got added, predictions from delegate types don't work
remotely.

Test update. Part 4 (Adapt to remote testing)

We updated the way test commands were created in joewalker/gcli/989537
to help with remote testing. This reflects those changes.
And it removes tests for values on remote types (because the values can't be
transferred across the remote interface)

See also https://github.com/joewalker/gcli/commit/989537615525b0d5ac980b1681e12177d8506fc4

Test update. Part 5 (Other changes)

We also added tests for custom properties, the new 'nudge' replacement
for increment/decrement, removed some settings mocks that we didn't need,
node type tests should access the NodeList properly

Lets have "console [open|close]" return nothing rather than a boolean

exec{output:...} is testing the string output, so using true should fail
but only succeeds because automagic type conversion.

Be brutal about errors dealing with the environment.

Fix misspelled attribute. Matters in an xhtml document.

Max line length = 80 chars. Wrap

Fix an increment/decrement → nudge that got forgotten

Fix csscoverage tests

I'm a bit lost as to how this worked before. start() requires those
arguments, and there is an obvious race when the navigation happens
before the listener has been added.

Update comments: textChanged is no longer an event

2 more ".then(null, " → ".catch("

Missed last time because we did them on the master GCLI branch. These
files are only on the mozilla branch.

A better check for when one keyboard event has overtaken another.

Perhaps we should get rid of 'updated' if the alternative is so simple,
and works in more cases.

Use platform promises rather than deprected-sync-thenables

Having done s/.then(null, /.catch(/g we're kind of nudged into this
because deprected-sync-thenables doesn't support .catch(). We've been
using DOM promises on the web for a while so I'm not too worried about
the implications of these being async.

Update highlight command for remote execution

This is a temporary hack. We probably want a better way to expose the
tabActor.

Enable tests in e10s mode

However it does not include the change to domtemplate.js. For that see
the next change, because I'm doing that slightly differently.

Merge from GCLI web (domtemplate.js → Templater.jsm)

Remove windowHolder

We removed windowHolder from GCLI in recent merge. This keeps the actor
in sync.

Subject: [PATCH 06/12] Add [add|remove]ItemsByModule to the GCLI actor

These are used by helpers.runTestModule().

It occurs to me that we could push definitions.js back into main.js
and use these functions to inject modules. I'm pondering wheter that's
something we should: A) Do now, B) Do later, C) Not do.

Subject: [PATCH 11/12] Fix 'edit' command

This is a tricky one. The 'edit' command uses the toolbox, so it's
clearly runAt:client, but it uses the 'resource' type which accesses the
DOM.

TL;DR: (Option 3)

The solutions that I've looked at are:

1. Create a new clientResource type that works for commands that
runAt:client. I'm sure there are Debugger/StyleEditor, etc APIs to do
the heavy work, but I'm hoping there is a quicker cheat.

2. Create a hidden command that's runAt:server with a resource
parameter, and then use the 'remote' type to point the real edit command
to use the resource type of the hidden command.

    exports.items = [
      {
        item: "command",
        runAt: "server",
        name: "edit",
        params: [
          {
            name: "resource",
            type: {
              name: "remote",
              commandName: "__hidden_edit",
              paramName: "resource",
            },
          }
        ],
        exec: function(args, context) {
          // ...
        }
      },
      {
        item: "command",
        runAt: "client",
        name: "__hidden_edit",
        hidden: true,
        params: [{
          name: "resource",
          type: { name: "resource", include: "text/css" },
        }],
        exec: () => { }
      }
    ];

This is neat, but the remote type expects that the 'import' process (as
defined by system.connectFront() will inject the front. Since there is
no import process here, that won't work. Maybe there is a non-hacky way
to get at the front?

3. Have the edit command be runAt:client and simply return 'args' (or at
least a JSONable version of that) and have a converter that actually
opens the style editor. In some ways you can see the style editor as the
'view' anyway, but I don't think this is ideal, however it is simple so
it's what I've done for now.

Also, the test suite was testing values, which it can't do for remote
types.
